Winky
=====

Winky is a small utility to check if your npm packages are up to date.  Simply
type `winky` in an npm project directory (one with a `package.json` file), and
Winky will tell you what needs to be updated.

### Known issues
Right now npm spits output to commands, and I haven't silenced them properly.
I'm happy to take PRs that fix that.
